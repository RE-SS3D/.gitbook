# üñº 2D

This document is a set of rules and guidelines for designing and contributing 2D assets for SS3D. It covers the UI elements, textures, decals, particles and so on. Nothing is set in stone, but for reasons of ‚Äúconsistency of style‚Äù these things should be kept in mind.

#### General Info:&#x20;

* In most cases, .png file format is to be used as it is easy to edit and supports transparency.
* For consistency it‚Äôs best to use the colors from the 3D pallet when possible.
* In case the image or it‚Äôs fragment needs to change color, an image should be made white, as Unity programmed coloring works by adding color to the image.
