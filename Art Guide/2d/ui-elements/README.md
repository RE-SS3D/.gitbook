# UI Elements

User Interface Style used in the project at the moment can be described as simple and clear: white or brightly colored and outlined elements on a black, 60% semi-transparent, blurred background.&#x20;

Text elements should be white as a general rule, and always be incased into a block of semi-transparent dark background with rounded edges. When colored (in chat or in case of warnings) text should be bright enough to be readable on the dark background, distinct enough from white text and slightly desaturated, Fonts used are available in the projectâ€™s google disk.&#x20;
