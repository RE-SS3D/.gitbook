# ðŸŽ¬ Artwork

Artwork refers to non-game assets, meaning assets which aren't made with the intent of them being added into the game. This may include thing like:

* Wallpaper renders
* Sticker/Emojis
* Gifs/Memes
* Trailers/Videos
* Music

These Artwork assets are used on our website, community pages, and discord server. It's possible some Artwork assets like wallpapers will be added as in-game assets.

_**Need to add guides and requirements for artwork assets...**_
