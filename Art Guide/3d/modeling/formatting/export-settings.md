# Export Settings

So, you've followed this guide to a T and now you're ready to export. Here are some notes before you export:

1. **Selected Objects** - This allows you to export only the objects you have selected. Highly recommended to toggle it on so you don't accidentally export the whole scene.&#x20;
2. **Apply Scalings** - Set this to FBX All This fixes some scaling issues in Unity.&#x20;
3. **!EXPERIMENTAL! Apply Transform** - This also fixes scaling issues in Unity, but primarily in regards to armatures. Just toggle it on anyway.&#x20;
4. **No Leaf Bones** - Turn off "Add Leaf Bones". It adds useless additional bones to the ends of armatures.
