# Variants

Many objects in SS3D will have variants to go with them, such as light bulbs and their broken counterparts, or different stages of construction, crafting, or consumption.

For a clean in-game transition from one variant to the next, it is important that all variants of an item have their origins in the same exact relative location.&#x20;

And while all variants of an item can technically be saved as different files, it is best that all variants of the same item are stored within the same .FBX file to decrease clutter within folders.&#x20;

When opening the .FBX files, the multiple objects can be distinguished within Unity.
