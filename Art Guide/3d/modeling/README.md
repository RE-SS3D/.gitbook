# Modeling

This guide is NOT a guide on 3D modeling itself, if you would like to learn, we recommend using the latest version of [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) (it's free) and watching a few tutorials on YouTube.

This guide is aimed at people who have the Blender basics down. Many people wanting to contribute are new to modeling so while thereâ€™s some general art advice, everything applies to SS3D.

The topics are in order of priority. Silhouettes are the most important thing, try not to add color or detail if you're satisfied with the shape of the model.
