The basic clothing types in this page mainly refer to things that are easy to edit from the reference items, such as shoes or gloves.

### Editing Reference Items

If you are inexperienced in weight painting, **take care not to model too destructively when modifying reference items**, or you may cause damage to the weighting of the mesh. This is especially difficult to fix when working in tight areas like the fingers of a glove.

**If you want to add details to the reference items, you may be better off duplicating the selected faces of a mesh using Shift+D**, which duplicates the faces' weighting as well.

And of course when you are finished making your item, make sure you create a placed/held item variant. Feel free to get creative with the positioning, as long as it still looks like one item.
