# Building the game

If you're developing, you'll need at some point to build the game so you can test it with multiple clients.

You can follow [Unity's instructions about building](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/BuildSettings.html) here if you need help with that.

We currently have two scenes in game, include them both, and you should be fine by leaving everything else default.

Click the `Build` button, and select the `Builds/Game` folder, if you don't, the build won't work !

That's it !&#x20;
