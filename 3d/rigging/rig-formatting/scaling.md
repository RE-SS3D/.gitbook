# Scaling

_**(This page will get removed once we resolve the size discrepancy issue.)**_

To match assets created before the human model was finalized, the rigged human model is scaled down .87 in-game.&#x20;

This creates a size discrepancy with a majority of items in the game. Because the rigged model is scaled down automatically in Unity, the size discrepancy is also negated automatically. Do not adjust the scale of the rigged model.

The dummy model included in the SS3D Modeler's Kit is the in-game size, while the rigging size is the size you should be working in for rigged items.
