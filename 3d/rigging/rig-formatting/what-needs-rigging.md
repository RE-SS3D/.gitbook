# What Needs Rigging?

Some objects don't need to be rigged, and can just be parented to the bones in-game. Below I will detail which items need to be rigged to the character armature, and which items do not.

#### Needs Rigged to Character:

* Hair
* Jumpsuits
* Overcoats
* Underwear
* Backpacks
* Gloves
* Shoes
* Belts
