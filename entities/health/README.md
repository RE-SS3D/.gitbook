# ðŸŒ¡ Health

_Letâ€™s get one thing straight: space is dangerous._

The depth of the health system will vary depending on the species of the character. Simpler entities may not have all of the following systems, for example it would be a waste of resources to simulate organs or blood for something tiny like insects.

The health system documented here assumes we are referring to the primary character type, humanoids, unless otherwise stated.
