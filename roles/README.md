Roles are the jobs players get at the start of a round, they decide what the player will spawn with and what permissions they will have in their ID Cards.

### Features

**Permission Checking**\
ID Cards have a set of permissions that allow you to have access to restricted areas or open locked containers.

**Loadouts**\
Loadouts set what each role spawns with, things like outfits and starting items, like a baton for a security officer.

**Role Selection**\
The system chooses players's roles the moment they join the lobby, currently a single player is chosen as Security and every other player gets the Assistant role.
