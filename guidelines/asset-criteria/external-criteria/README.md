# External Criteria

## External Asset Criteria

_<mark style="color:orange;">**The criteria used to check art assets**</mark>** **<mark style="color:red;">**BEFORE**</mark>** **<mark style="color:orange;">**importing them into Unity.**</mark>_

This criteria specifically focuses on the details of the file as it was created in whatever external (non-Unity) program.

Many of these art assets were already check based on our criteria when they were originally submitted, but many (especially the older ones) have not. So all art assets should be double checked prior to being imported into the Unity project via a GitHub pr.

Due to the nature of different art asset types, we have different acceptance criteria for each. This includes 3d models, 3d animations, textures, graphics, and audio.

Also, each art asset type is not bound by 1 set of criteria. Because assets of the same type are used in different ways inside the project they may have different acceptance criteria based on their use.

_The following subpages are based on asset types while they may have sub pages but will be based on_ [_object type_](../../../introduction/file-naming-and-organization/file-organization/object-type.md)_._
