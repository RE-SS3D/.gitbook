# ðŸ’¬ Chat

SS3D has two types of chats available: the lobby chat and the in-game chat.

#### The lobby chat

The lobby chat is useful between rounds and for players that haven't embarked yet. The only channels that can be used there are the OOC channel and the System channel.

The script in charge of handling the lobby chat is LobbyChatWindow, which can be modified in the Lobby GameObject inside the Game scene. The reason why the component is part of the Lobby and not the Chat itself, is because the chat gets disabled and enabled when using the tabs, and a disabled chat won't receive messages. This way, the chat is always enabled.

The lobby chat includes a delayed Welcome message, only sent to the player when they first join the server (before embarking). It can be useful to add some server-specific messages and information.

#### The in-game chat

The in-game chat is considerably more complex than the lobby chat. Apart of the System and OOC channels (also included in the lobby chat), it includes the rest of channels for both OOC and IC communication. A full list of current channels can be found at the end of this page.

The in-game chat window can have several tabs, where each tab includes a list of channels. When joining a round, the chat starts with a default "All" tab, which includes all channels available on start - like Local, OOC, etc. The player can add more tabs by pressing the plus ("+") button at the top left corner of the chat, selecting the desired channels and setting a custom name for the tab. Not selecting any channel will result in a tab with only non-hidable chat channels (like the System channel). The tabs can be reordered by dragging them around, and dragging them out of the tab list will create another chat window - so several chat windows can be opened at once.

On the bottom left corner, there's a dropdown to choose which channel to speak through. The list of channels depend on the current selected tab - so channels not part of the tab won't be available in the dropdown.

Finally, the in-game chat window can be resized and dragged around the UI, so the player can choose the layout they like the most.

#### Adding and modifying chat channels

Chat channels are implemented using ScriptableObjects. To add a new channel, just create a new Chat Channel with Right Click (on the Project folder) > Create > SS3D > UI > Chat > Chat Channel, and add it to the list of available channels in the ChatChannels asset settings.

There's a list of options to set up the channel to your needs: how to display the character name, the color and format of the chat, if it requires a trait to be used, if should only work within a distance, etc. Check the tooltips of each var for a more complete and updated information.

#### Expanding the messages

The way messages are formatted, or the options of the channels, can be easily expanded by either modifying the ChatChannel.cs (for adding more variables) or the ChatMessage.cs (for modifying how a text is displayed). Chat messages are formatted only once - when the player sends it. This is done client-side.
