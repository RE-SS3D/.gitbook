# ğŸ“‘ Traits

_**Ideas for Traits can be found**_ [_**here**_](https://trello.com/c/cGtU5esq/3-traits)_**.**_

Traits can be used to check for basic properties by name, like what category an item is part of or what permissions an ID Card holds, they can also be separated into categories, currently there are just two, **"None"** and **ID Permission.**

### Item Traits and Filters

You don't have to set anything up, just name the Trait, first be certain there are no other traits in the project with the same name.

To create a trait go to **Assets/Content/Data/Traits**, right click and go **Create -> Inventory -> Traits -> Trait.**

Filters are used by container to filter which items can be stored inside them, they check for traits in the items for that.

To create a filter go to **Assets/Content/Data/Filter**, right click and go **Create -> Inventory -> Traits -> Filter.**
