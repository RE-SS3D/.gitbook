# Containers & Items

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

**Accepted Traits:** Traits the items will need to be stored inside the container.\
**Denied Traits:** Traits that are denied, regardless or if the item has accepted traits.\
**Must Have All:** Check if the item must have all traits to be stored instead of just a single one.



### Adding traits and filter to items and containers

To add a trait to an item just go to it's prefab and add it to the Traits list:
