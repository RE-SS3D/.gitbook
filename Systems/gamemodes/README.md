# ðŸ”« Gamemodes

Gamemodes are what allow a round to begin and end, they set up the objectives that need to be completed by either antagonists or crew members, when these objectives are met the round ends, or alternatively, the shuttle can be called to end it.

They are separated into 2 features, Modes and Objectives.

* **Modes** are what decide how the round is gonna end, how many traitors the round will have and what objectives there will be.
* **Objectives** are things antagonists or crew members must achieve during the round, they are given either to individual players or groups of players, with the objectives being shared or not between them, meaning either an objective can be completed by one player and it's completed by everyone, or it can be solely completed by a single player, making other players fail the objective.
