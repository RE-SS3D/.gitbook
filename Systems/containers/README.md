# ðŸ§° Containers

Containers are the virtual representation of a space in which items might fit.

Containers are currently equivalent to Rectangle grid of slots, where one can put items in. (add picture here)

The number of items a container can contain depends on the grid size.

A container with a 5x5 size will be able to contain as much as 25 items.

Items themselves have a size and therefore, can take multiple slots.

Containers are synchronized among clients, meaning that when one client modify a container, all other clients observing this container will see it changed.
