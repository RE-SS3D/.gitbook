# ðŸ”— Gitbook and Github syncing

Gitbook and github are automatically syncing, at least that's true for the Home, Design, Art Guide, Dev Guide, Systems and Management space.&#x20;

Any space added later will need to be configured to sync. The syncing allow us to have a backup of our gitbook data in case of a catastrophic lost.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Do not modify files directly on github unless you know what you're doing ! It syncs BOTH ways !&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If you add another space, follow the doc here to sync it \

[https://docs.gitbook.com/integrations/git-sync/enabling-github-sync](https://docs.gitbook.com/integrations/git-sync/enabling-github-sync)

When syncing another space, don't let the root folder by default, otherwise it'll make a mess on github.&#x20;

Add a folder with a similar name to the space you created
