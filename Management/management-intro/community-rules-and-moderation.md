# Community Rules & Moderation

_**(this document needs to be expanded more)**_

You can find the communities we are responsible for moderating under the [Sites & Accounts page](sites-and-accounts/#communities), but this also expands to all our sites including comments on our GitHub repositories, Trello boars, YouTube channel, etc..

## Rules

1. Don't be a dick
2. No NSFW content or other forms of degeneracy.
