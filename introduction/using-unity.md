# Using Unity

## Downloading Unity

You will need the correct Unity version to run the project. There are two ways you can acquire it:

#### Method 1:

Check what our [current Unity version](using-unity.md#current-version) is, then find that specific version in the Unity download archives below.

#### Method 2:

Download [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download), then open our project using the hub and it should auto-detect our Unity version and prompt a download for that version.

## **Current Version**

To avoid having to update the current version in this document every time it's updated, we will just point you to the version file instead.
