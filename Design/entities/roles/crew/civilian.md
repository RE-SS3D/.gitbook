Civilians generally have less-complex and less-responsible jobs compared to other departments, which makes them good for beginners or more relaxing rounds.

The roles in this department vary more than any other.

<summary>Botanists</summary>

**Quantity: 2-4**

Botany is the source of the station’s necessary (and unnecessary) vegetation. The overarching goal of the botanist is not too dissimilar to the goal of the chef, filling the stomachs of the crew members (botanists will get requests for ingredients from the bartender and chef).

But procuring the requested goods may be a bit of a process. In a basic sense, the botanist’s goal is to grow, maintain, and harvest crops, then repeat the cycle. However, a botanist also has the hardware to check the genetic traits of each crop, and ensure they are always replanting the best of the best for greater numbers, higher potency, and even genetic mutations for more bizarre and unique crops.

Getting tired of making wheat? Why not produce some meat-wheat?\
Is the station a little lifeless? Why not throw some walking mushrooms into the hallways?

<summary>Chef</summary>

**Quantity: 1**

What increases morale more than a stomach full of food? Probably not much, but nobody would know better than the station’s chefs.

As the game progresses, crew members will fall victim to hunger, which will deplete their sanity and movement speed. The chef should expect to see a wide number of crew members with different tastes that encourage the player to learn how to make a variety of dishes.

The chef’s goal is to keep the station fed, ~~and harass the Botanist to make more wheat~~. On a populated station, the chef will (hopefully) be one of the most active crew members, and on downtime, can ~~finally grab a bite to eat for themselves~~ experiment with the cooking system to see what dishes are possible.

<summary>Bartender</summary>

**Quantity: 1**

Bartenders are one of the few role-play centric jobs on the station, but that doesn’t mean their job has no depth; the bartender can be thought of as a low-level chemist, and is a great job for beginning players. While a large portion of their job does indeed include talking to whoever walks into the bar, the second half of the job is mixing drinks for their patrons, who are also players that might want something simple, or will challenge the bartender’s knowledge of mixology.

Often at the heart of the station, the bartender will likely be one of the first people to witness the station fall victim to traitors and incompetent crew members.

<summary>Janitor</summary>

**Quantity: 1**

Janitors are the station’s first line of defense against complete chaos. Think about it, if the place looks like a madhouse, people will act like it, too. **The objective of the janitor is clear:** **keep the station clean.**

It’s not a very complicated job, but it’s a rewarding one that can give a player joy when they see the hallways spotless. This role is ideal for players who like a slow-paced role that benefits everyone.

It also makes for a good beginner role because the job itself is not complex and you get to travel and learn the layout of the map.

<summary>Clown</summary>

**Quantity: 1**

The clown and mime are similar entertainment roles with the bonus of injecting a bit of mischief into the station. Unlike the mime, the clown is conducive to high-octane hijinx and loud shenanigans. the mime role is significantly more reserved, and works well for methodically thought-out pranks.

Additionally, the clown is noisy and clumsy. They have various clothing and items which make noise and they have a gene which causes clumsiness.

The clown and mime are similar entertainment roles with the bonus of injecting a bit of mischief into the station. Unlike the clown, the mime is significantly more reserved, and works well for methodically thought-out pranks.

Additionally, the mime is quiet and sneaky. They have several abilities that only mimes can use, and and have to stay silent and mime out all communication or else..!

<summary>Assistant</summary>

**Quantity: \_UNKNOWN**\_

Assistants are crew members with limited access, who are subordinate to all other crew members. Wearing their trademark gray jumpsuit, on down time they can focus more on learning the game, or enjoying the role-playing experience the station has to offer.

When all other crew roles have been filled by players, new players will 'overflow' into the assistant role, forcing them to choose this role or become a ghost and look for ghost roles. As a result, in larger rounds there often times are many assistants to due this crew overflow.
