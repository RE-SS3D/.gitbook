# Antagonists

As a compliment to any good protagonist, antagonist roles also exist on the station. Many antagonists are capable of existing at the start of rounds, or can appear in the middle of the round as well (under specific circumstances).

Antagonists (aka Antags) are categorized into 2 main categories; primary and secondary.

1. **Primary Antagonists** - usually more detailed with more complex abilities and goals. **They are designed to have a large impact on the round, and as such, they are usually only spawned at the start of a round.**
2. **Secondary Antagonists** - usually more basic with less unique abilities and goals. **They are designed to have little impact on the round, and as such, they are usually only spawned in the middle of the round.**

That being said, primary antags can be spawned mid-round and secondary antags can be spawned at round-start if the admins choose to do so.
