# Secondary Antags

**Secondary antagonists** are usually more basic with less unique abilities and goals. **They are designed to have little impact on the round, and as such, they are usually only spawned in the middle of the round.**

Blobs are a station-eating blobulous mass that intends on feasting on the station everyone inhabits. The goal for the blob is simple: consume. As a blob, the player must choose a location for the core of their body to spawn, from which point the blob will begin to spread.

Spreading into occupied tiles will destroy the tile. Performing actions as a blob costs resource points, which generate over time. The player can choose to allocate resource points to lay down specialized blob tiles, as well as production of smaller allies that can travel and deal damage.

For a comprehensive list of the blob’s abilities, [see here](https://tgstation13.org/wiki/Blob#Blob\_Powers). Biologically, not all blobs are alike, and each blob may have different attributes depending on its strain. For a list of blob strains and how they react, [see here](https://tgstation13.org/wiki/Blob#Blob\_Powers).

Victory for the blob occurs when the blob reaches its goal for the number of tiles occupied.
