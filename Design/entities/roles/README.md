SS3D focuses on a dynamic that is primarily between players. Aside from a few basic mobs, this game features very few NPCâ€™s. Instead, the well-being of the station hinges completely on the competence of the crew members, and the antagonists who put it in danger.

Victory for each player can mean something completely different depending on who â€“ or what â€“ you are. This is because each player occupies a specific role that contributes in some way to the environment around them. In this section, we focus on the types of roles the players will be occupying.
