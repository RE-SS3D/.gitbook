# ⚔ Combat

Combat is a character-on-character interaction system that mainly focuses on keeping player character and allied characters alive/functional and rendering hostile characters not-alive/functional.

The main tools of character-on-character interaction are clicking on the character and the body part selection dummy:

Clicking on a target dummy’s body part would select it and highlight it for the player. It would be used for context related character-on-character interactions, such as aiming or disarming. Same dummy is used for medical purposes.

It is used for the most common type of characters: anthropomorphic ones, such as humans, abductors, plasmamen or podpeople. For lizardmen, felinids, mothmen or xenomorph-expy creatures additional features can be added, such as tails, wings or antennae.

* hit/punch people with or without an item in one's hands
* disarm the target
* shove the target
* grab and pull the target
* throw the target
* Fireman carry target
* throw things at the target
* shoot the target
* taze/inject/forcefeed the target

There should be a battle mode (harm) and a non-battle mode (help), that should affect the effect of the click on the other character. There should be an ability to:

Body parts can also be selected via hotkeys, native for experienced SS13 players.

Creatures like goats, cows, dogs or space carp would need their own target dummies. If a player clicks on a non-standard creature, the target dummy would change from standard to edited one. If the changed one is still anthropomorphic, the original selected body part would remain. Otherwise, the torso or a center of mass would be automatically selected.
