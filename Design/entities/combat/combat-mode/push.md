# Push

#### PUSH

RIGHT\_CLICK on an active target character, while having an empty hand, will result in an attempt to push the target.

(IK-rig needed. Target character should be pushed in the direction of the push and slowed down very slightly for 3 seconds, unless they collide with any other objects. In case of said collision, the target character should become a ragdoll for 3 more seconds starting from the collision time.)

RIGHT\_CLICK on a target character that grabbed the player's character, should result in an attempt to push away the target and disable the grab (with a certain chance).
