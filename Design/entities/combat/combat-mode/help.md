## HELP

If the Combat mode is <mark style="color:green;">disabled</mark>, most of the actions performed on the characters are supposed to be non-harmful (at least, not directly, see details below):

LEFT\_CLICK on an active target character, while having an empty hand and Combat mode is <mark style="color:green;">disabled</mark>, will result in giving the target a hug. (This action also pets animals)

LEFT\_CLICK on a knocked down target character, while having an empty hand and Combat mode is <mark style="color:green;">disabled</mark>, will result in an attempt to help the target back up on their feet.

LEFT\_CLICK on a target character in a critical condition, while having an empty hand and Combat mode is <mark style="color:green;">disabled</mark>, will result in an attempt to perform CPR and revive the target.
