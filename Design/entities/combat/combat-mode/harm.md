# Harm

## HARM

LEFT\_CLICK on an active target character, while having an empty hand and Combat mode is <mark style="color:red;">enabled</mark>, will result in an attempt to punch the target in the selected bodypart.

(On standing targets player character will attempt to punch the target, which deals 1.5-15 stamina and 1-10 brute (CRUSH subtype) damage. The chance to miss a punch increases the more stamina and brute damage player character has. Punching has a chance to knockdown the target for at least 4 seconds. The more brute and stamina damage the target has, the longer the target will be knocked down.) For more info on Stamina and Damage types, visit Health design document: Health/Medical design document

Suggestion: longer LEFT\_CLICK should result in a stronger, slower attack.

LEFT\_CLICK on a knocked down target character, while having an empty hand and Combat mode is <mark style="color:red;">enabled</mark>, will result in a kick of the target in the selected bodypart. (The kick deals 1.5-15 brute (CRUSH subtype) damage and has no chance to miss.)

The damage of any attack that is made using character's muscles should also depend on the

* Overall health condition of the attacker
* Health of the limb used to attack
* Stamina amount (debatable)

One of those factors (chosen by the worst condition) should reduce character's damage with melee fights.
