# Body parts volume

This data is useful as it gives us some rough rough idea about things such as the volume of blood in a given body part, if we make the simple approximation that blood quantity is homogeneous in the body (obviously untrue, but good enough for SS3D).

* Average volume of a human body : 65 L\

* Volume of intestines :\

* Volume of Heart, lungs and liver :\

* Volume of stomach :\

*   Volume of limbs :

Using those sources, we can approximate the volume for each body part :

For the torso and its organs :

* Total Torso = 50 % of 65L = 32.5L
* Heart = 0.3 L
* Lower and upper Intestines = 1 L each
* Liver = 1.5L
* Lungs = 0.7L each
* Stomach = 2L
* Total volume of Torso without organs = 32.5 - 0.3 - 1 - 1 - 1.5 - 0.7\*2 - 2 = 25.3 L

For the limbs :

* left/right arm = 4% of 65 L = 2.6L
* left/right hand = 1% of 65 L = 0.65L
* left/right leg = 14% of 65 L = 9.1L
* left/right foot = 2% of 65 L = 1.3L

For the head and its organs :

* total head = 8% of 65L = 5.2L
* Brain = 1.3L
* Eyes = 0.03 L each
* head without organs = 5.2 -1.3 - 0.06 = 3.8L
