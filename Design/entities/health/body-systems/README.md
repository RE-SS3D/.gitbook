# Body Systems

The health system is composed of many different and optional complex systems, which we will divide into Body Layers and Body Parts from now on.

## Body Layers <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Gu82RVgvMEJshQ79i0fFAW66sFtgTQLpF0AfwWAyR1F3l7HRUfMEF4FfTpmX8vjrk_9rxG7ehL-0jjHLnOS2A6S8CC0wLM7EWRi5OGGk5-j8qg-7am-LlKL4CxpPE6MiTQBYwsnmByIs66rAcKTFVw" alt="" data-size="line">

One of the main systems of any biological character is the system of their tissue layers. Humans are generally made of muscle, connective, neural, bone and other types of tissues, each providing different functions and having different ways of being affected by the outside world.

<table><thead><tr><th width="168">Body Layer</th><th>Descryption</th><th>Function</th><th>Injury/Failure</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>MUSCULAR</td><td>Layer of skin, fat and muscle. Easiest to get to through surgical access.</td><td>Provides motoric function and registers sensory information.</td><td>Damaged body part and it's organs lose function.</td></tr><tr><td>SKELETAL</td><td>Layer of bones and gristle. Deepest to get to through surgical access.</td><td>Holds body together, prevents mutilation, generates small quantity of blood.</td><td>Enables mutilation.</td></tr><tr><td>CIRCULATORY</td><td>Layer of blood vessels. Connects to all layers and organs. Source: Heart (Head).</td><td>Provides all layers, body parts and organs with oxygen and nutrients.</td><td>Enables bleeding (see Blood (add link later)).</td></tr><tr><td>NERVOUS</td><td>Layer of neural tissue. Connects to all layers and organs. Source: Brain (Torso).</td><td>Provides player control and receives sensory information.</td><td>Removes sensory information and function of affected part.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Circulatory System

The circulatory system makes the heart pump the blood through the organism; blood goes through various organs in the torso and distributes oxygen and nutrients to other body parts, so the root of the system should be located in the Torso and depend on the heart.

This also means, that if the intermediate link in this hierarchy is damaged, the child link should have less blood delivered as well as the damaged part itself. The easiest way to imagine it is to think of it as a number of interconnected containers.

### Nervous System

The nervous system is also connects all over the body, but the hierarchy is different:

Which also means that if the intermediate link in this hierarchy is damaged, the child link should have worse chance to provide sensory information or receive a brain's command to function as well as the damaged part itself. That means that if the NERVES are severed in some body part, it’s connection to the brain is lost along with the parts that are lower on the hierarchy. If NERVES for the body parts are damaged, the character’s ability to make precise movements is damaged as well, to a point of losing control of the body part completely, depending on the severity of the damage.

Below is a breakdown of players’ body parts, and what they do.

<table><thead><tr><th width="133">Body Part</th><th>Function</th><th>Injury/Failure</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Hands</td><td>Allows players to interact with most of the world.</td><td>Loses their function.</td></tr><tr><td>Arms</td><td>Connects the body to the hands.</td><td>Loses their function &#x26; connected hand's function.</td></tr><tr><td>Feet</td><td>Allows the player to walk and run.</td><td>Loses their function</td></tr><tr><td>Legs</td><td>Connects the body to the feet.</td><td>Loses their function &#x26; connected foot's function.</td></tr><tr><td>Head</td><td>Contains several organs including the brain, eyes, ears, &#x26; tongue.</td><td>Injury may damage the organs. Severing will kill the organs.</td></tr><tr><td>Torso</td><td>Contains several organs including the lungs, stomach, intestines, liver, kidneys, spleen, appendix, &#x26; pancreas.</td><td>Injury may deal damage to contained organs.</td></tr><tr><td><del>Tail</del></td><td><del>Provides balance.</del></td><td><del>Causes genetically-tailed creatures to occasionally fall over &#x26; struggle running if severed.</del></td></tr></tbody></table>
