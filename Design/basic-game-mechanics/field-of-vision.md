# ðŸ”¦ Field of Vision

Players should only see what their characters reasonable can see.

That means not being able to see through walls and some other large opaque objects, but being able to see through windows or other large objects with transparent materials.

Additionally, the color and transparency of the FOV itself can be adjusted. This could be used for a variety of things.

It could turn green and grainy when the character's eyes are exposed to radiation. It could turn 90% transparent to  simulate x-ray vision. Etc...
