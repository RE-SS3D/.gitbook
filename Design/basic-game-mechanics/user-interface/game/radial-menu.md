<mark style="color:yellow;">**Radial Menu**</mark>: Sometimes, just clicking is not enough to specify how you wish to react with a particular object; if a player wants to change the radio station on a boombox, how does the game know not to pick it up instead? This is the purpose of the radial menu. When holding right click on an item, the radial menu appears with a list of possible interactions.

In the case of a boombox, the player may see the option to pick it up, turn it on/off, or change the song. From this point, all the player needs to do is move their mouse in the direction of the desired option to interact accordingly.

### Ideas:

Fill the inner circle with a generic/common interaction like Point or Pick Up. Alternatively and inner ring could be added that has a different type of interaction, like emotes.
