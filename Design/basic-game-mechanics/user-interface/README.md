# ðŸ–¥ User Interface

**This page is for the design of the User Interface overall.**\

Text elements should be white as a general rule, and always be incased into a block of semi-transparent dark background with rounded edges. When colored (in chat or in case of warnings) text should be bright enough to be readable on the dark background, distinct enough from white text and slightly desaturated.

Fonts used are available in the projectâ€™s art GitHub repo.

_The follow pages use concept images and ideas; please ignore wrong backgrounds, fonts, and/or icons..._
