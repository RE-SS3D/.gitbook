Things to place objects into.

A storage locker, an ore box, a cooking pot, a cigarette box, a chest cavity: if it can hold an object or a substance, it is a container.

Players should be able to open, access the containers and interact with the contents: take stuff out and put stuff in.

Depending on the container, the items within can also be used by some system even without player's direct control. For example, a magazine has it's bullets removed with every shot from the weapon this magazine is installed in. The contents of a gas cannister should be released in the atmosphere, should it ever be opened into it. Etc.
