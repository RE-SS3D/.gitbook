# ðŸ›° Environment

_Space Station 3D_ takes place several centuries in the future on a research station owned by the megacorporation known as Nanotrasen. The station deals in genetics, virology, cybernetics, xenobiology, research of exotic materials (like 'plasma' or 'bluespace' minerals), mining, scavenging or general space exploration. Most of the time this station is floating through space, but it is not unheard of having a research station on land of some planet.

While Nanotrasen's influence and power have effectively made them a government entity, they are a force that is generally far away from the station itself, leaving it's residents to deal with their everyday challenges on their own. Station's general task is to stay operational, generally intact, and do the tasks NT gives them.
