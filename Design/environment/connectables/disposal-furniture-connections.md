# Disposal furniture connections

Disposal furnitures don't change meshes when they connect to a disposal pipe, however, they should signal to disposal pipe just below them, when they have a single connection, that they need to update and become a vertical pipe.

Upon removal, they should signal to the disposal pipe that they can update their mesh to an horizontal one.
