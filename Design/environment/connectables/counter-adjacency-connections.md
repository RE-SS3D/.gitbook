# Counter Adjacency Connections

Counter connections use the “Counter Adjacency Connector” script. This script is very similar to the basic adjacency connections but has a couple of unique shapes that are specific to counters. The basic shapes “O”, “U”, “I”, “L”, “T”, and “X” are all the same from the basic connector. The unique counter shapes are defined below:

U2 - A “U” type variant that is shortened. The reason for this is it can be used to connect Counters to Walls.

Door - A special “I” type variant that can be rotated to allow it to open.

Door Frame - A special “I” type variant that is used with the Door variant (on the same tile).
