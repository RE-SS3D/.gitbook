# ðŸ“ž Communication Systems

The station can be quite large, with up to 100 players actively doing something. While not being a focus of the gameplay, it can also provide interesting opportunities for it.

People need to communicate with each other, the station needs to have a way to request supplies, security have a need to share info that is on "need to know basis", AI and borgs have a unique way of communicating and, of course, the spies and traitors are allways on the lookout for some juicy rumors and corporate secrets. This just asks for an advanced communication systems with several points of failure.

The ideas of localized relays were proposed, where player could disrupt comms in one area of the station and it would take a while before people outside realize that there's a murderboning assistant in science for example. But tcomms indeed are super complex and probably unecessarily so.

It did allow for a lot of fun things like running custom user defined scripts on incoming signals, but that got removed on tg, though the whole receiver/mainframe/server/broadcaster/processors/hubs thing could probably be slimmed down.
