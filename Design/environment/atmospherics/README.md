# ‚òÅ Atmospherics

The Atmospherics system (atmos).

Gasses must be able to be transferred through a complex network of pipes, and must regulate pressure between rooms. For example, if a low pressure room is adjacent to a high pressure room, and the door between them is open, **air should flow from the high pressure room into the low pressure room, until pressure is equalized**. Ideally, this should cause wind that, if strong enough, should blow anything not buckled down in the direction of the airflow.

The gas in the atmosphere may not be a singular gas, actually that will rarely be the case. Most atmosphere will be made up of a mix of gases. Gases naturally mix together and equalize over time, much in the way pressure equalizes overtime.

It is important to manage both the pressure and gas mixture of the atmosphere in your work station.
