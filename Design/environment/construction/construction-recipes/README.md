# Construction Recipes

How things are built, specifically.

Even within the sections below, the construction processes may vary depending on the object type. For example the construction recipes for a metal wall will be different from a wood wall or rock wall.&#x20;

_Current recipes may not be final._

### Underlying design:

1. Have a material and a tool in hands
2. Apply tool to material
3. Select an option in the menu
4. Wait for build to complete
5. Drag the frame of the object to the desired place (optional)
6. Attach the object to the grid by applying a tool to it
7. Apply materials and tools to complete the object

For furniture building it's even more simple, as most furniture works even without being fastened or bolted to a tile, not to mention that some furniture is built right away, without the need to make a frame for it first.
