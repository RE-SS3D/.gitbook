## Airlocks <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Gu82RVgvMEJshQ79i0fFAW66sFtgTQLpF0AfwWAyR1F3l7HRUfMEF4FfTpmX8vjrk_9rxG7ehL-0jjHLnOS2A6S8CC0wLM7EWRi5OGGk5-j8qg-7am-LlKL4CxpPE6MiTQBYwsnmByIs66rAcKTFVw" alt="" data-size="line">

Airlocks are built like most machines, starting with a frame which is bolted to the ground, then materials and components are added.

Airlocks can be merged together up to 3 tiles long. They need to merge in the construction phase. Once the door is completed it wont be able to merge with others and will prevent other door skeletons from being bolted next to it.

**Example:** To build a 2 tile door, you'll need to build 2 door skeletons side by side, wrench them both and they will connect, then you can finish building the airlock.
