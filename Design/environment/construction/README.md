# üèó Construction

Crew members should have the ability to alter, fix and or dismantle the structure of the station.

Which means that any person should be able to create or interact with walls and floor ~~and ceiling~~ of the station, should they have right materials and tools. The mane philosophy is allowing the player to affect the structure with a simple click of a mouse.

_Rules of_ [_connectables_](../connectables/) _apply._

The station is built like a cake. Every layer of the station's structure is built on top of a lower layer.

The bottom layer is Girder: the base for things to be put into or on top of. Inside there is room for disposals and two layers of pipes.

Above the girder, hiding the pipes and sealing the station room from the bottom, is the floor, that has room for three layers of pipes for atmos shenanigans, junctions used to switch pipes between layers, transit tubes and tiles.

On top of the floor, hiding the wires and insulating the room are tiles: an extra room layer made to support furniture and walls.

This is the layer people actually supposed to walk on, but carpets on, bolt furniture on and build Walls upon. Walls are pretty self-explanatory: it limits the room, seals and insulates the rooms from the sides ~~and supports ceiling:~~

## Walls / Windows <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Gu82RVgvMEJshQ79i0fFAW66sFtgTQLpF0AfwWAyR1F3l7HRUfMEF4FfTpmX8vjrk_9rxG7ehL-0jjHLnOS2A6S8CC0wLM7EWRi5OGGk5-j8qg-7am-LlKL4CxpPE6MiTQBYwsnmByIs66rAcKTFVw" alt="" data-size="line">

_The construction process for walls/windows may vary depending on their type._

In any case, the wall starts with a metal wall girder. It's like a frame for a wall to be filled with metal or glass to be completed. It can be made on a spot, if player character has metal rods or what have they in one hand and a tool for connecting them in the other. Applying a tool to the materials (dictated by the crafting recipe(ADD LINK TO CRAFTING PAGE) or a choice in the opened menu for building) results in creating a physical, always upright (to avoid toppling down) metal structure in front of the player.

It can be dragged or pushed to be relocated to a different location. In order to be connected to the other walls, it needs to be bolted to a tile, adjacent to the other object of the same type. Player just needs to drag the girder to the nearest wall, place it near the center of the needed tile and bolt it using a wrench.

From that point onward it can also be upgraded to a full wall or a window, since even if it's connected to a wall, the girder is not very durable, does not block cosmic vacuum or doesn't even break player's line of sight. See below an example of wall construction/deconstruction.

Reinforcement and other forms of modifications should also be built on the same principle.

## Airlocks (doors) <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Gu82RVgvMEJshQ79i0fFAW66sFtgTQLpF0AfwWAyR1F3l7HRUfMEF4FfTpmX8vjrk_9rxG7ehL-0jjHLnOS2A6S8CC0wLM7EWRi5OGGk5-j8qg-7am-LlKL4CxpPE6MiTQBYwsnmByIs66rAcKTFVw" alt="" data-size="line">

_The construction process for airlocks may vary depending on their type._

Doors are built from a frame (skeleton) which is bolted to the ground then materials and components are added.

Doors can be merged together up to 3 tiles long. They need to merge in the construction phase. Once the door is completed it wont be able to merge with others and will prevent other door skeletons from being bolted next to it.

**Example:** To build a 2 tile door, you'll need to start building 2 door skeletons side by side, wrench them both and they will connect, then you can finish building the airlock.

The same underlying design for construction is simple:

1. Have a material and a tool in hands
2. Apply tool to material
3. Select an option in the menu
4. Wait for build to complete
5. Drag the frame of the object to the desired place (optional)
6. Attach the object to the grid by applying a tool to it
7. Apply materials and tools to complete the object

For furniture building it's even more simple, as most furniture works even without being fastened or bolted to a tile, not to mention that some furniture is built right away, without the need to make a frame for it first.
