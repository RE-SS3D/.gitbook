# Planets

The planets work on the same principle as the space station, with a few differences.&#x20;

The first one is that the research station is no longer nesessarily surrounded by a total vacuum. There could be atmosphere of the planet itself, though it might still not be exactly breathable. For example, a planet completely covered in CO2.

The second one is that there is no longer a need for an artificial gravity generators. The gravity outside of the station might still be lower (or higher) then what the crew might find comfortable, but it's probably not going to be zero.

The third one is that the station is going to be in a middle of some environment, be it a sea of lava, a blasted desert, a rocky mine or something else.&#x20;
