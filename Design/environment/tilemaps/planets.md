# Planets

Planets work on the same principle as stations, with a few differences.

The first one is that the map structure is no longer completely surrounded by a vacuum. There could be atmosphere on the planet itself, though it might still not be exactly breathable. For example, a planet completely covered in CO2.

The second one is that there is no longer a need for an artificial gravity generators. The gravity outside of the station might still be lower (or higher) then what the crew might find comfortable, but it's probably not going to be zero.

Next is power generation. Some power generators like solar panels may be less efficient in general and have less workable hours at all due to day/night cycle on the planet.

Finally, the station is going to be in a middle of some environment, be it a sea of lava, a blasted desert, a rocky mine or something else.
