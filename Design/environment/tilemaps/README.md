Maps will come in a variety in Space Station 3D but can be categorized into 2 main types; station-like and planet-like.

## Station-like <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Gu82RVgvMEJshQ79i0fFAW66sFtgTQLpF0AfwWAyR1F3l7HRUfMEF4FfTpmX8vjrk_9rxG7ehL-0jjHLnOS2A6S8CC0wLM7EWRi5OGGk5-j8qg-7am-LlKL4CxpPE6MiTQBYwsnmByIs66rAcKTFVw" alt="" data-size="line">

Station-like maps ("Stations") are any map that is _mostly_ made up of artificial structures and is **NOT anchored to any larger cosmic body** like an asteroid, moon, or planet. The only thing immediately outside of the artificial structure is the vacuum of space.

This includes, regular space stations, derelict/destroyed space stations, satellites, shuttles, or other ships.

Planet-like maps ("Planets") are any map that is **anchored to a larger cosmic body** like an asteroid, moon, or planet. These maps have walkable 'land' outside of the artificial structures and sometimes even an atmosphere.

This includes most of the typically mining locations, like lavaland, asteroid, or even&#x20;
