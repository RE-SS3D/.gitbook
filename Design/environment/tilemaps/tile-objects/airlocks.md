# Airlocks

## Behavior of airlocks

Airlocks are currently simply acting as doors that open when a player gets near and close a few moments later only if a player is not blocking it.

This automatic behavior will be used on some common area airlocks, but secured airlocks should require an interaction to open. Clicking on them with an open hand (if your ID has access and is in your ID slot OR in your PDA which is in your ID slot) or a hand occupied with your ID that has access OR PDA that has ID in it.

## Airlocks cosmetics

Upon opening, red lights illuminate.

When idle (either opened or closed), the lights turn black.

Airlocks make some sound when opening and closing.
