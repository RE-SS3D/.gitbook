# Airlocks

## Behavior of airlocks

Airlocks are currently simply acting as doors that open and close when a player goes close to it.

When a player get close to an airlock, the airlock opens . The airlock stay opened as long as a player is close to the opened airlock. When no player are close to it, the airlock closes after a small amount of time.

This behavior is temporary, or it could be one possible mod of airlocks (automatic mode).

Ideally, airlocks should be interactive, and they should be opened and closed by players interacting with them.

Their precise behavior in this case must still be defined.
