# Art Style

**Something to remember: Although SS3D is a goofy, quirky, cartoony game... it is also a detailed, complex, simulator that "attempts**" **to be fairly realistic. There is a fine balance here.**

## Style

Retro Futuristic - advanced technology since it's in the future but older technologies aren't often replaces (so you will still see CDs, cassettes, laptops, etc.).
