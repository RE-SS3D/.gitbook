# Server Lobby

The Server Lobby is the menu for the individual server after you have chosen to connect to one via the Server Hub. From here you can join the round (if in progress) or spectate it.

It also serves several other purposes:

1. Provides server information/images custom to each server.

2. Includes a lobby chat to talk in OOC with the other people in the server.\

3. Provides a list of players and possibly occupied roles.

4. Allows changing the game settings (video, audio, UI, etc.. as in [#in-game-settings](server-lobby.md#in-game-settings "mention")):

5. Allows editing/saving character presets at any point prior to embarking.\

6. Grants server settings to admins so they change aspects of the round and start/stop rounds.\
