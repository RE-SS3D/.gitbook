# ‚è≥ Rounds

Rounds are a way to set a time limit on the game and act as a condition for winning or losing in the game. Generally, if player's character survives and/or completes their task successfully, they are considered winners.&#x20;

Players should be able to join other servers either at the start of the round or while the round is already going (the game already been happening for some time)
