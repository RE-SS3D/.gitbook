# FishNet Networking

In order to network stuff we need a framework. We aren't doing it from scratch ~~(again)~~. We used to use **Mirror** but I found [**FishNet Networking**](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/fish-net-networking-evolved-207815), and I haven't used anything else since. It has free and paid features, which is lame, but we can use it at our favour.

I'll add important notes about developing with in the next sections.
