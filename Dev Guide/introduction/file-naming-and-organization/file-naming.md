# File Naming

When (re)naming files and folders always do so using ['PascalCase'](https://techterms.com/definition/pascalcase), this makes naming consistent which helps with organization and clarity.

## **✔️ Correct**

**`LockerDoorAnimationController.file`**

## ❌ Wrong

`Locker Door Animation Controller.file`\
`lockerdoor animation controller.file`\
`AnimationController - LockerDoor.file`

\
Also, acronyms should be treated as words. For example:\
`JanitorIdImage.file`\
NOT\
`JanitorIDImage.file`
