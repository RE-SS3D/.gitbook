# Object Type

Object type sorting is specific to object-related assets. Which is all assets in the Art folder and many in the Content folder.

[The Assets folder on the GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n9oCtlF6snAzWmzeD8wjdCuiOo-a1\_R4?usp=share\_link) (and art repo) are organized the same as the Art folder on the game repo. First sorted by asset type, then by object type. Not all folders will have all types.

### Object Types:

_(The first 4 types in the list below are where 95% of common objects are kept.)_

<details>

<summary>Entities</summary>

<mark style="color:green;">**In-game objects**</mark> that have 'life' per-se. This includes player races, animals/monsters, robots/borgs, and even vehicles.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Items</summary>

<mark style="color:green;">**In-game objects**</mark> which can be picked up, stored on your character, or moved in a variety of ways (physics?). EX. bikehorn, bananas, guns, clothing, etc..

</details>

<details>

<summary>Furniture</summary>

<mark style="color:green;">**In-game objects**</mark> which are too large to store on your character, most of which cannot even be picked up. EX. tables, chairs, plants, machines, etc..

</details>

<details>

<summary>Structures</summary>

<mark style="color:green;">**In-game objects**</mark> similar to furniture but are nearly exclusive to the structure of the station (tilemap). EX. walls (& wall mounts), floors, plenums, wires, pipes, etc..

</details>

<details>

<summary>World</summary>

<mark style="color:green;">**In-game objects**</mark> which are 'other' objects pertaining to the world itself. EX. skyboxes or other backgrounds, character customization room, VFX &  SFX, etc..

</details>

<details>

<summary>Editor</summary>

<mark style="color:orange;">**Non-game objects**</mark> which are used in the Unity editors for display or other reasons. (This will likely only be used in the /Art/ subfolder, NOT the /Content/ subfolder. Reason being is we use broad Editor folder in the /Content/ folder.)
