# üìù Dev Intro

This page outlines the guidelines for contributing to the SS3D project. If you have any questions, feel free to ask on our [discussions page](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/discussions) or [discord server](https://discord.gg/Z3sPhyS).

The game itself is made in Unity and written in C#, check out our [C# style guide](guidelines/the-c-style-guide/). We use [FishNet](networking/fishnet-networking/) for networking.

For art contributors, read through the subpages under this page, then head over to the [art guide](http://127.0.0.1:5000/o/2tc30IysZr2Usu0TTxAY/s/o88TIFUbxlEVDM0ZH62q/).
