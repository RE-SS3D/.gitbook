# The C# Style Guide

This style guide is based on [this other C# style guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/c-sharp-style-guide/blob/master/README.markdown) and expands upon it.

You can use whatever file editor you want, but [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is probably the most popular and recommended choice. It's free, has many features, and integrates well with Unity and Git.&#x20;

If you're a student, we recommend getting a copy of [JetBrain's Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) which adds a lot of code hints and shortcuts that will significantly improve your code quality.

Our overarching goals are **clarity**, **readability** and **simplicity**. Also, this guide is written to keep **Unity** in mind.

### Inspiration

This style guide is based on C# and Unity conventions, and discussions within the development team.

### Automation

We recently added an [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) file to automate the code review process, it is a file you can add to [Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/create-portable-custom-editor-options?view=vs-2022) or [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/editorconfig.html) and it will apply the formatting and style we use to your analyzers, telling you when something is out of order.
