# Asset Criteria

All assets should meet the specified criteria when contributing to the project, and maintainers will refer back to this when reviewing GitHub PRs ~~and direct art submissions in Discord~~.

General assets are categorized by 2 types in our project as you should know from our [file organization](../../introduction/file-naming-and-organization/file-organization/). These two types, internal and external, have different criteria based on their nature.

_The sub pages contained under this one will be split based on these 2 types, but we will also be adding a 3rd page to represent the importing criteria of external assets._
