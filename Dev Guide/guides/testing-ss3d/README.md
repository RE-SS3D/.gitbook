# Testing SS3D

Unity divides tests in two categories, play tests and editor tests. We decided to divide those tests into more subcategories. Here's a summary of the hierarchy, and you can find on the following pages a description of each of those, allowing you to choose the right category when writing a new test.

* Play tests
* Editor tests
  * Asset audit&#x20;
  * Edit mode
