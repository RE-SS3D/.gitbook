# ‚≠ê Quick Start

{% hint style="info" %}
G**ood to know:** Use the tools you prefer. I personally love Fork for my Git ~~bloatware~~ uses, and JetBrains Rider for my IDE. However, we do not discriminate, even, _if you're using VIM_.\

### Settings up for development

A quick web search will teach you how to do any of these steps

1. Fork the [SS3D repository](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D).
2. Find a task to work on.
3. Open a pull-request to the **develop** branch.

Pretty easy right?

### Software & Tools

* For the game engine, we are using [Unity](https://unity.com/).
* To network the game, we are using [Fish-Net: Networking Evolved](https://github.com/FirstGearGames/FishNet).
* We use [DOTween](http://dotween.demigiant.com/) for tweening purposes.
* We also use the [CS Framework](https://github.com/coimbrastudios/framework).

### Recommendations

* Read about [GitFlow](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/devops/tools/getting-started-with-gitflow/).
* The book [Game Programming Patterns by Robert Nystrom](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/).
