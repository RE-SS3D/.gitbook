# Advanced Adjacency Connections

Advanced connections use the “Advanced Adjacency Connector” script. They are a direct extension to the ‘basic connections’, intended to solve the issue of gaps where the corners meet. This works by using the same shapes as the ‘basic connections’ in addition to some new variants for all shapes with possible corner connections (“L”, “T”, and “X”).\
These advanced corner shapes are defined below:

L2 - An “L” type variant with a connection in its corner, to the north east.

T2 - A “T” type variant with a connection in its southwest corner.

T3 - A “T” type variant with a connection in its southeast corner.

T4 - A “T” type variant with a connection in both corners, southeast and southwest.

X2 - An “X” type variant with a connection in its north east corner.

X3 - An “X” type variant with 2 adjacent corner connections, 1 north east and 1 north west.

X4 - An “X” type variant with 2 opposite corner connections, 1 north east and 1 south west.

X5 - An “X” type variant with 3 corner connections, north east, north west, and south west.

X6 - An “X” type variant with a connection in all 4 corners.

### Examples of Advanced Connectables

#### **Plenum Covers**

Plenum covers are part of the same prefab as the plenums. They cover the plenums and connect them together.

#### **Carpets**

Carpets are a great example of a type of floor tile that can be stylized and designed to be connectable.

Carpets come in a variety of colors, all of which can connect to create some creative patterns.

Other floor types that may possibly connect are lava, grass, dirt, etc.

#### **Tables**

Tables are the iconic connectable that everyone loves from SS13. The ability to build an infinite number of possible shapes of tables is a truly satisfying feeling.

Tables also come in a variety of material-based types (wood, metal, etc.) and use unique specific types to prevent connections between these different material-based types.

#### **Girders**

Girders are basically unfinished walls so it seems fitting their generic type would be “wall” (see the ‘Walls & Windows’ section below for more details).

Girders come in a variety of material-based types similar to the tables, but unlike the tables, different girder types CAN connect to each other.

#### Walls & Windows

Walls and windows are very similar to girders, which makes sense as they are all “wall” by generic type. All 3 can have additional components (supports, struts, sheets, etc.) overlapping the primary model to give the effect of adding/removing parts via construction (more info can be found in the construction documentation).

In most cases, these additional components will inherit the same adjacency connector as the primary model (advanced) due to the fact that most of the components are the same complexity or simpler.

One notable exception would be the ”window dividers” component. This component is a bit more complex in order to get window dividers to connect properly (see the [Window Divider Adjacency Connections](window-divider-adjacency-connections.md) for more details).

Another exception is the “door frames” component. This component bridges the gap between walls and airlocks, smoothing the transition and giving the appearance of something for the airlock to reside within (see the [Airlock Tile Adjacency Connections](airlock-adjacency-connections.md) for more details).
