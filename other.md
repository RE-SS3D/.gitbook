# ðŸŽ¬ Other

Other refers to non-game assets, meaning assets which aren't made with the intent of them being added into the game. This may include thing like:

* Wallpaper renders
* Sticker/Emojis
* Gifs/Memes
* Trailers/Videos
* Music

These Other assets are used on our website, community pages, and discord server. It's possible somethings like wallpapers may actually get added into the game as backgrounds during a lobby screen or something.

_**Add more specifics for these assets...**_
